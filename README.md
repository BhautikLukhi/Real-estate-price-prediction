# Real-estate-price-prediction

In this project I have analyzed the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values, building a prediction model and much more. At the end we compare results from different ML algorithms and choose the best one to implement in out prediction model.
